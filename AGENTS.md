# AI Agent Entry Point: hy-home.docker

## Welcome, Agent

You are working in a **Docker Compose Monorepo** for a Home Lab Environment. This is a complex, high-availability system.

## Primary Directives

1. **Read the Rules**: Your first action MUST be to read `.cursorrules` and the contents of `.agent/rules/`.
    - `.cursorrules` contains the technical context and strict dos/don'ts.
    - `.agent/rules/` contains the behavioral standards.

2. **Explore First**: Do not assume standard paths.
    - Infrastructure is in `infra/`.
    - Scripts are in `scripts/`.
    - Documentation is in `docs/`.

3. **Use specific instructions**:
    - If you are **Claude**, read `CLAUDE.md`.
    - If you are **Gemini**, read `GEMINI.md`.

## Goal

To build a resilient, observable, and documented infrastructure.
