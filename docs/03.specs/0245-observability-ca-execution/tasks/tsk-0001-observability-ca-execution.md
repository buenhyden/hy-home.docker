# Observability CA Execution Task

## Overview

### Objective

Complete service-specific backup and isolated-recovery rehearsals for
Prometheus and Gatus before either CA recreation, then recreate Prometheus
before Gatus while preserving production data boundaries.

## Inputs and Authorization

- **Request:** on 2026-10-16 the owner authorized the current host's
  Prometheus and Gatus backup/restore validation followed by their bounded CA
  application and recreation.
- **Authorization boundary:** this Task covers only the two named services,
  one at a time, in Plan order. It excludes secret or raw-data capture,
  OpenBao operations, a stack-wide restart, an unreviewed image pull, a
  Prometheus upgrade, manual data manipulation, volume deletion, and
  production-data restoration or replacement.
- **Baseline:** `main` `89eb43f683a11587cf4f125be534ae720c20a55c`.
- **Known starting observation:** Prometheus was observed on its 3.14 rollback
  image and both named services lacked the required CA mount at runtime. Gatus
  requires a no-network/no-pull minimal delta image with `FROM` its exact
  current running immutable base and `COPY` of only the reviewed tracked
  CA-aware entrypoint, with its binary unchanged, before recreation; a
  same-image recreation is not accepted as CA evidence.
- **Planned protected artifacts:** the reviewed backup/isolated-restore packet
  selects `/home/hyunyoun/storage/backups/r13-observability-ca-20261016-01`.
  Workspace artifacts require mode 0700 and isolated-restore tar siblings mode
  0400. The path shares device 2064 with production data, so it is a
  pre-recreate recovery gate only, not a disk-failure disaster-recovery claim.

## Work Log

### Initial State

The approved Spec and Plan define the execution order. No backup, isolated
restore, image build, CA application, recreation, or operational review has
run under this Task.

### Ready Transition

On 2026-10-16, W1 bound the exact, value-free backup phase contract and its
two guard helpers to the selected host-local protected artifact path. The
contract specifies the two recovery gates before either CA recreation, the
Prometheus-then-Gatus recreation order, same-device non-DR limitation, and
the mode-0700 workspace/mode-0400 tar-sibling controls. This makes the Task
`ready` to begin a reviewed W2 or W4 gate; it is not a backup, restore, image
build, service recreation, or operational-review result.

The Task transitions to `in-progress` only when an approved W2 or W4 recovery
gate actually starts. The reviewed recovery packet must still pass its
independent IaC/security review before the relevant operation proceeds.

| 2 | pending | - | Await W2 backup and isolated restore | @buenhyden |
| 3 | pending | - | Await W4 backup and isolated restore | @buenhyden |
| 4 | pending | - | Await W4 build identity | @buenhyden |

| 6 | pending | - | Await W6 outcome if a gate fails | @buenhyden |
| 7 | pending | - | Await W7 reviews and checks | @buenhyden |

## Review and Completion

This draft has no accepted criterion. Completion requires the service-specific
execution evidence listed in SPEC-0245; a source-only check, image build, or
Compose render does not prove a production backup, isolated restore, or CA
application.
