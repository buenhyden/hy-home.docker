# Native Memory Controlled Verification Task

## Overview

### Objective

Record only what an authorized, non-mutating native-session verification can
prove about memory and hooks, with unsupported state left visible as
unverified or unknown.

## Inputs and Authorization

- **Request:** on 2026-10-16 the owner asked to continue Claude memory-off
  and hook verification as part of the bounded operational follow-up.
- **Authorization boundary:** a normal Claude session may use the approved
  read-only status and menu actions. After it proves effective memory-off, one
  provider prompt may read and write only the exact ignored fixture, with at
  most three turns, USD 0.10, strict empty MCP, and no Chrome, Bash, or network
  tools. It may not read or write native/shared memory, change settings or
  trust, inspect raw private diagnostics, or widen the fixture boundary.
- **Baseline:** `main` `89eb43f683a11587cf4f125be534ae720c20a55c`.
- **Related evidence:** SPEC-0212 TSK-0009 contains the prior sanitized menu
  observation. It is historical input only; this Task does not reopen it.

## Work Log

### Initial State

This Task begins in `draft`. The approved Spec and Plan define W1 through W5;
no new native-session action has been run under this Task. A later transition
to `ready` requires the W1 control record and review. A transition to
`in-progress` requires an actual authorized session attempt or gate execution,
not a documentation-only status change.

## Evidence

| Evidence | Criteria | Work Unit | Check | Input | Result | Location | Required | Resolves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Initial native execution state | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 | W1, W2, W3, W4, W5, W6 | No controlled session, review, conditional fixture probe, or selected document gate has run for this Task | Initial record on `89eb43f683a11587cf4f125be534ae720c20a55c` | NOT_RUN | Initial State | required | - |

## Criterion Acceptance

| Criterion | Acceptance | Evidence | Decision | Current Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | pending | - | Await W1 control record | @buenhyden |
| 2 | pending | - | Await W2 observation | @buenhyden |
| 3 | pending | - | Await W3 non-mutating effective-memory-off proof | @buenhyden |
| 4 | pending | - | Await W4 receipt classification | @buenhyden |
| 5 | pending | - | Await W5 boundary and cleanup record | @buenhyden |
| 6 | pending | - | Await W6 review and gates | @buenhyden |

## Review and Completion

This draft has no accepted criterion. Completion is limited to the source
verification contract in SPEC-0244; it does not accept provider-global state,
individual hook delivery without a receipt, or shared-memory implementation.
