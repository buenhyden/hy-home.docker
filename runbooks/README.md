# Operational Runbooks

This directory is the **exclusive home** for all executable operational procedures, incident response playbooks, and deployment guides.

*If it tells a human or an automated system "how to do something to the infrastructure", it belongs here.*

## Rule

**Never place these files in `docs/runbook`.**
Placing operational logs inside the long-term documentation hub leads to clutter and confusion. The DevOps Agent expects to find all operational scripts and procedures directly in this root-level `/runbooks/` folder.

## Creation

Every runbook generated by the DevOps Agent MUST use the `templates/operations/runbook-template.md` base.

## Agent Guidelines & Standards

AI Agents generating or modifying service runbooks inside this directory MUST adhere to `.agent/rules/0381-runbooks-oncall.md`.
Specifically, all service runbooks must conform to the structure defined in `[REQ-RBK-STR-01]` (including Dashboards, SLOs, Alerts, and Rollbacks). Any automated deployment rules will block production releases if a compliant runbook does not exist for a given service.
